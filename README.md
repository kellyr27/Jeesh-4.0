A personal exploratory creative project aimed at learning to use the REACT framework and ThreeJS library. Click on the cones and move them within the Arena using the Selection Panel. Customize the UI using the Leva panel. Deployed at [jeesh.com](https://jeesh.com).

## Inspiration

The name Jeesh is derived from the sci-fi novel "Ender's Game," describing a group of Battle School Army. An army would compete in a Battle Room, a zero-gravity arena where two armies compete to reach the opposing Army's gate. This was the original inspiration for the project, where I implemented a game inspired by the Battle Room in Jeesh 2.0 using Vanilla JavaScript with ThreeJS.
